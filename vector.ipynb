Viswanathan, J.\\n1. Leave granted.\\n2. Vashist Narayan Kumar (the appellant) hails from a small village \\nnamed Dheodha in Bihar. He belongs to the downtrodden segment of \\nthe society. He aspired to become a Police Constable and had applied \\nfor the said post under the reserved category. Having possessed \\nthe eligibility criteria of being an intermediate (10+2 pass), he also \\ncleared the written examination and the Physical Eligibility Test.\\n3. The appellant submitted his educational certificates/mark sheet as \\nwell as his caste certificate for document verification. On 11.06.2018, \\nthe final results reflected him as having failed. The only reason was \\nthat, while in the application form uploaded online, his date of birth \\nwas shown as 08.12.1997, in the school mark sheet, his date of \\nbirth was reflected as 18.12.1997. \\n4. Distraught, the appellant represented and thereafter having failed to \\nreceive any response, filed a writ petition before the High Court. His \\nexplanation was simple and straight forward. He stated in his writ \\npetition that, after noticing the advertisement issued by the Central \\nSelection Board on 29.07.2017, he from his remote village went to the \\nCyber café at Pakribarawan - a nearby town. With the assistance of \\na person running the Cyber café, he filled in his form and uploaded \\nit online and he received application No. 7236126 indicating thereby \\nthat the online application had been duly filled. His case was that, \\nwhile filling up the form, by an inadvertent error, the date of birth had \\ngot recorded as “08.12.1997” instead of “18.12.1997”. He derived \\nno benefit from it as either way he fulfilled the eligibility criteria and \\nthe age requirement. He prayed for the relief in the nature of a', metadata={'source': 'judgment.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='4 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS\\nmandamus to the respondents to consider his claim for selection \\nand direct them to issue an appointment letter treating the date of \\nbirth as 18.12.1997, as reflected in his educational certificates. \\n5. The respondents vehemently opposed the writ petition. It was their \\nstand that the advertisement had clearly stipulated that candidates \\nshould correctly mention their date of birth according to their 10th \\nboard certificate; that if any discrepancy was found while matching the \\ninformation, the candidature would be cancelled; that the candidate \\nshould read the instructions carefully and if any information is \\nfound false or wrong, then the application form would be cancelled \\nand legal action will also be taken. It was further averred that the \\nadvertisement also mentioned the method of making corrections and \\nthat the appellant never availed that facility. \\n6. They contended that out of 9900 vacancies advertised, 9839 \\ncandidates were declared successful. They submitted that 61 \\nvacancies remained unfilled due to non-availability of suitable Gorkha \\ncandidates. They prayed for the dismissal of the writ petition. \\n7. The learned Single Judge, after referring to the clauses in the \\nadvertisement, including the clause providing for correction, held that \\nsince incorrect information was provided, no relief could be given. The \\nappellant filed a Letters Patent Appeal to the Division Bench, which \\nhas been dismissed by the impugned order. The Division Bench, \\nwhile affirming the order of the learned Single Judge, additionally \\nrecorded a finding that the appellant had not sought for quashing of \\nthe result, as declared on 11.06.2018, on the website.\\n8. Being aggrieved, the appellant is before us in this Appeal. \\n9. We have heard Ms. Shaswati Parhi, learned counsel for the appellant \\nand Mr. Azmat Hayat Amanullah, learned counsel for the State. \\nLearned counsels have reiterated their respective contentions as \\nadvanced in the Courts below. They have also relied on the judgments \\nof this Court and of some High Courts, in support of their respective \\npropositions. Learned counsels have also filed comprehensive written \\nsubmissions.\\nQuestion for Consideration \\n10. The question that arises for consideration is whether the error \\ncommitted in the application form, which was uploaded is a material', metadata={'source': 'judgment.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  5\\nVASHIST NARAYAN KUMAR v. THE STATE OF BIHAR & ORS.\\nerror or a trivial error and was the State justified in declaring the \\nappellant as having failed on account of the same?\\nDiscussion\\n11. Admittedly, the appellant derived no advantage as even if either \\nof the dates were taken, he was eligible; the error also had no \\nbearing on the selection and the appellant himself being oblivious \\nof the error produced the educational certificates which reflected his \\ncorrect date of birth. \\n12. The facts are undisputed. The appellant’s application uploaded \\nfrom the cyber café did mention the date of birth as 08.12.1997 \\nwhile his date of birth as recorded in the educational certificate \\nwas 18.12.1997. It is also undisputed that it is the appellant who \\nproduced the educational certificates. He was oblivious of the error \\nthat had crept into his application form. It is also undisputed that \\nthe advertisement had all the clauses setting out that in case the \\ninformation given by the candidates is wrong or misleading, the \\napplication form was to be rejected and necessary criminal action \\nwas also to be taken. It also had a clause that the candidates \\nhad to fill the correct date of birth, according to their 10th board \\ncertificate. The clause further stated that candidates will fill their \\nname, father’s name, address etc. correctly in the application form. It \\nstates that any discrepancy, if found, while checking the documents, \\nthe candidature of the candidate will stand cancelled. There was \\nalso a clause providing for correction of wrong/erroneously filled \\napplication forms, which stated that the errors can be corrected once \\nby re-depositing the application fee and filling a new application. It \\nalso provided that those filling the application on the last date could \\ncorrect the application till the following day.\\n13. Equally undisputed is the fact that after filling out the application, the \\nappellant cleared the written examination and the Physical Eligibility \\nTest. It was also stated in the counter affidavit that there were 61 \\nunfilled vacancies though it was submitted that it was meant for the \\nGorkha candidates. \\n14. We are not impressed with the argument of the State that the error \\nwas so grave as to constitute wrong or mis-leading information. We \\nsay on the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case. Even the', metadata={'source': 'judgment.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='6 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS\\nState has not chosen to resort to any criminal action, clearly implying \\nthat even they did not consider this error as having fallen foul of the \\nfollowing clause in the advertisement:-\\n“Instructions to fill online application form are available \\non the website. It is recommended to all the candidates \\nto carefully read the instructions before filling the online \\napplication form and kindly fill the appropriate response \\nin the following tabs. In case, the information given by \\nthe candidates found wrong or misleading, the application \\nform will get rejected and necessary criminal actions will \\nalso be taken against the candidate.”\\n15. Recently this Bench in Divya vs. Union of India & Ors., \\n2023:INSC:900 = 2023 (13) Scale 730, while declining relief to \\ncandidates who acquired eligibility after the date mentioned in the \\nnotification carved out a narrow exception. There, the judgment in \\nAjay Kumar Mishra vs. Union of India & Ors., [2016] SCC OnLine \\nDel 6563, a case very similar to the facts of the present case, was \\nnoted. In Ajai Kumar Mishra (supra), Indira Banerjee, J. (as Her \\nLadyship then was) speaking for the Division Bench of the Delhi \\nHigh Court in para 9 stated as under:-\\n9. It is true that whenever any material discrepancy \\nis noticed in the application form and/or when any \\nsuppression and/ or mis-representation is detected, the \\ncandidature might be cancelled even after the application \\nhas been processed and the candidate has been allowed \\nto participate in the selection process. However, after a \\ncandidate has participated in the selection process and \\ncleared all the stages successfully, his candidature can \\nonly be cancelled, after careful scrutiny of the gravity of \\nthe lapse, and not for trivial omissions or errors.”\\n(emphasis supplied)\\nThe exception for trivial errors or omissions is for the reason that \\nlaw does not concern itself with trifles. This principle is recognized \\nin the legal maxim - De minimis non curat lex. \\n16. Learned counsel for the appellant, in her written submissions, cited \\nthe following judgments in support of her proposition that inadvertent', metadata={'source': 'judgment.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  7\\nVASHIST NARAYAN KUMAR v. THE STATE OF BIHAR & ORS.\\nerror in filling up the date of birth when no advantage is derived will \\nnot constitute a wilful mis-representation and contended that in all \\nthose cases reliefs were given to the candidates:\\ni) Arkshit Kapoor  vs. Union of India , 2017 SCC OnLine Del \\n10154 [para 20]\\nii) K. Sangeetha vs. Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission \\n(2018) SCC OnLine Mad 5075 [Paras 9 & 11]\\niii) Anuj Pratap Singh  vs. Union Public Service Commission, \\n2018 SCC OnLine Del 10982 [Paras 15,16 & 21]\\niv) Shubham Tushir vs. Union of India , 2019 SCC OnLine Del \\n9831 [Paras 4 & 10]\\nv) Staff Selection Commission & Anr.

In fact, in Anuj Pratap Singh (supra), as is clear from para 14 of \\nthe said judgment, the candidate unable to correct the error at the \\nfirst point was forced to repeat it while submitting the application for \\nsitting in the main exam since he had no other option. The Court \\naccepted the explanation and condoned the error in the filling up of \\nthe column pertaining to the date of birth. \\n18. The learned counsel for the State drew attention to the verification \\nby the appellant, of the details in a printed form furnished by the \\nselection board. He contended that the appellant signed the form \\nwhich carried the date of birth. First of all, the form was a printed \\nform which reflected the date of birth as given by the appellant and \\nthe appellant signed the printed form on 10.03.2018. We are inclined \\nto accept the explanation of the appellant that since the appellant \\nwas unaware of his own mistake he had mechanically signed the \\nprinted form. It is only later, on 11.06.2018, on the publication of \\nthe result that the appellant realized the error. We do not think that \\nthe appellant could be penalised for this insignificant error which \\nmade no difference to the ultimate result. Errors of this kind, as \\nnoticed in the present case, which are inadvertent do not constitute \\nmisrepresentation or wilful suppression.', metadata={'source': 'judgment.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='8 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS\\n19. In this case, the appellant has participated in the selection process \\nand cleared all the stages successfully. The error in the application \\nis trivial which did not play any part in the selection process. The \\nState was not justified in making a mountain out of this molehill. \\nPerhaps the rarefied atmosphere of the cybercafe, got the better of \\nthe appellant. He omitted to notice the error and even failed to avail \\nthe corrective mechanism offered. In the instant case, we cannot turn \\na Nelson’s eye to the ground realities that existed. In the order dated \\n22.11.2021 in C.A. No. 6983 of 2021 [Prince Jaibir Singh vs. Union \\nof India & Ors.], this Court rightly observed that though technology \\nis a great enabler, there is at the same time, a digital divide. \\n20. In one of the cases cited as a precedent in the counter affidavit, \\nbefore the High Court, Pankaj Paswan vs. State of Bihar Anr ., \\n2015 SCC On Line Patna 8739, the State had taken a defence that \\nmany candidates applied in more than one place and hence there \\ncould be deliberate tweaking in the date of birth to take advantage \\nof the selection process in more than one district or region. It is very \\nimportant to notice that there is no such plea taken in the present \\ncase. If any such device or trick had been adopted, the State would \\nhave easily detected the same and placed the same before the Court. \\nThe fact that the same has not been done shows that there was no \\ntrick or device resorted to by the appellant. It is a trivial error which \\nappears to be a genuine and bona fide mistake. It will be unjust to \\npenalise the appellant for the same. \\n21. Learned counsel for the State, in the written submissions, stated that \\nthe instructions clearly stipulated that if two or more candidates obtain \\nthe same marks in the Physical Eligibility Test, their relative rank in \\nthe final merit list could be determined on the basis of their date of \\nbirth. The implication in the submission is that the date of birth is a \\nsignificant aspect. On that basis, he submits that the cancellation \\nought to be upheld. We do not find merit in the submission. The \\noriginal date of birth, as available is 18.12.1997, in the educational \\ncertificates. There is no dispute that the appellant’s date of birth was, \\nin fact, 18.12.1997. In view of that, we do not see the said clause in \\nthe instructions as an impediment for the selection of the appellant.\\n22. Learned counsel for the State has also, in the written submissions, \\ncited the judgment of this Court in Yogesh Kumar and Others', metadata={'source': 'judgment.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  9\\nVASHIST NARAYAN KUMAR v. THE STATE OF BIHAR & ORS.\\nvs. Govt. of NCT, Delhi and Others, (2003) 3 SCC 548. The said \\njudgment is clearly distinguishable. There the issue was about allowing \\nentry of ineligible persons into the selection. While the eligibility \\nprescribed was Teacher’s Training Certificate from a recognized \\ninstitute or intermediate or equivalent from a recognized Board/\\nUniversity with an elective subject in the required language at the \\nmatric level, candidates with B.Ed. degree sought appointment as \\nAssistant Teacher. Negating their claim, this Court held that the \\nB.Ed. qualification cannot be treated as a qualification higher than \\nthe Teacher’s Training Certificate, because the nature of the training \\nimparted for grant of certificate and for grant of degree was totally \\ndifferent. In that context, this Court held that deviating from the rules \\nand allowing entry to ineligible persons would deprive many others \\nwho could have competed for the post. Yogesh Kumar (supra) has \\nno application to the facts of the present case. Equally distinguishable \\nare the judgments of the Delhi High Court in Rohit Kumar and \\nAnother vs. Union of India and Others, 2022 SCC OnLine Del \\n1219 and Pradeep Kumar vs. Union of India and Others, 2022 \\nSCC OnLine Del 239.\\n23. In the case of Rohit Kumar (supra), the undisputed facts, as is \\nclear from para 10 of the judgment, was that the candidate was \\ndeclared unsuccessful on two counts, namely, that the OBC certificate \\nuploaded by the candidate was not as per the format as mentioned \\nin the advertisement and additionally on the ground that the date \\nof issuance of the certificate was wrongly mentioned in the online \\napplication. \\n24. In Pradeep Kumar (supra), the identity proof (Aadhaar Card) was not \\nuploaded and instead the self photograph of the candidate has been \\nuploaded. We find that the said two judgments are distinguishable \\non facts for the reasons set out above. \\n25. On the peculiar facts of this case, considering the background in which \\nthe error occurred, we are inclined to set aside the cancellation. We \\nare not impressed with the finding of the Division Bench that there \\nwas no prayer seeking quashment of the results declared over the \\nweb. A reading of the prayer clause in the writ petition indicates that \\nthe appellant did pray for a mandamus directing the respondents \\nto consider the candidature treating his date of birth as 18.12.1997', metadata={'source': 'judgment.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='10 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDIGITAL SUPREME COURT REPORTS\\nand also sought for a direction for issuance of an appointment letter. \\nA Writ Court has the power to mould the relief. Justice cannot be \\nforsaken on the altar of technicalities.\\nConclusion\\n26. For the reasons stated above, we set aside the judgment of the \\nDivision Bench of the Patna High Court in LPA No. 1271 of 2019 dated \\n22.08.2022 and direct the respondent-State to treat the appellant as a \\ncandidate who has “passed”, in the selection process held under the \\nadvertisement No. 1 of 2017 issued by the Central Selection Board \\n(Constable Recruitment), Patna with the date of birth as 18.12.1997. \\nWe further direct that if the appellant is otherwise not disqualified, \\nthe case of the appellant be considered and necessary appointment \\nletter issued. We further direct that, in the event of there being no \\nvacancy, appointment letter will still have to be issued on the special \\nfacts of this case. We make the said direction, in exercise of powers \\nunder Article 142 of the Constitution of India. We further direct that the \\nState will be at liberty in that event to adjust the vacancy in the next \\nrecruitment that they may resort to in the coming years. We notice \\nfrom the written submissions of the State that 21,391 vacancies have \\nbeen notified in Advertisement No.1 of 2023 and it is stated that the \\nprocedure for selection is ongoing. We place the said statement on \\nrecord. We direct compliance to be made of the aforesaid direction \\nwithin a period of four weeks from today. \\n27. The appeal is allowed in the above terms.
